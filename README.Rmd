# Default Data Science Project Directory

The folders in this project are:

* _data_ - all the data you have collected or been \
given to analyze.
  + _raw_ - data from external sources, not to be edited.
  + _tidy_ - organized, munged, prunded, and/or joined data for analysis
  + _final_ - final data output, but only that which is not publicized
* _analysis_ - tests, internal reports, exploratory analysis and graphs. 
  + _figures_ - graphs, charts, html produced in other reports
  + _reports_ - data from external sources, not to be edited.
  + _data_ - publicized datasets (.csv, .xlsx, etc)
* _code_ - create code files for collecting, cleaning up, or analy\
zing data.
* _documentation_ - written explanation of package and sources
  + _R_ - for example, R code would go here.
* _products_ - this is the place where you will plac
  + _figures_ - graphs, charts, html produced in other reports
  + _reports_ - written reports (.docx, .pdf, etc)
  + _data_ - publicized datasets (.csv, .xlsx, etc)
* _README_ - project root documentation
* _.gitignore_ - instructions for git to ignore files. By default set to ignore data/tidy, data/final, analysis/* and products/*.

Obviously all folder structure is flexible; this is only a starting point to make sure our analyses orbit around a different structure.

Note: all .gitkeep files can be deleted; they're only here so the folders will show up.
