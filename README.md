# Default Data Science Project Directory

The folders in this project are:

  - *data* - all the data you have collected or been  
    given to analyze.
      - *raw* - data from external sources, not to be edited.
      - *tidy* - organized, munged, prunded, and/or joined data for
        analysis
      - *final* - final data output, but only that which is not
        publicized
  - *analysis* - tests, internal reports, exploratory analysis and
    graphs.
      - *figures* - graphs, charts, html produced in other reports
      - *reports* - data from external sources, not to be edited.
      - *data* - publicized datasets (.csv, .xlsx, etc)
  - *code* - create code files for collecting, cleaning up, or analy  
    zing data.
  - *documentation* - written explanation of package and sources
      - *R* - for example, R code would go here.
  - *products* - this is the place where you will plac
      - *figures* - graphs, charts, html produced in other reports
      - *reports* - written reports (.docx, .pdf, etc)
      - *data* - publicized datasets (.csv, .xlsx, etc)
  - *README* - project root documentation
  - *.gitignore* - instructions for git to ignore files. By default set
    to ignore data/tidy, data/final, analysis/\* and products/\*.

Obviously all folder structure is flexible; this is only a starting
point to make sure our analyses orbit around a different structure.

Note: all .gitkeep files can be deleted; theyâ€™re only here so the
folders will show up.
